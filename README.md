- Sealed Boxes - you give me an open padlock, I lock message and send
- Public-key Signatures - I give you key to padlock, lock hash of message
- Authenticated Encryption - combine the first two!
- Key Exchange - generate symmetric keys from asymmetric keys.
- Content Addressable DAG - Great for storing large data graphs
- Merkle Tree with signed roots - Great for tracking history
- DHT with derived discovery keys - private peer discovery
- Using public key as address for cert-less key exchange (xsalsa20 stream)
- HAMT (hash array mapped trie) log to implement K/V store
- Multi-writer by authorizing other streams
- Ring Signatures - someone in the ring signed, but we don't know who. (safe leaks)
- Deniable Authentication - receiver is in ring, nobody else can verify.
- Threshold ring signatures - multiple signers cooperate to sign together.
- Linkable ring signatures - can know if two messages used same signer (still anonymous)
- Traceable ring signature - detects and reveals multiple messages signed by same (voting)
